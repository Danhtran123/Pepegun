Pepegun is a 3rd person bullet hell/shoot em up game with the main character of Pepe. Pepegun was inspired by classic bullet hell games such as Touhou or RaidenX but we wanted to modernize it with ideas which have appeared in modern times from games such as Risk of Rain 2 and Enter the Gungeon. Pepe is on a mission to stop various organizations from censoring Pepe and memes. Pepe will start with a machine gun and he will eventually be able to get different kinds of weapons such as a shotgun or a laser beam. These weapons will have upgrades to them which will be achievable after destroying the bosses. Pepe has different ways to survive such as using dodge rolls to gain invincibility frames from projectiles or using bombs to destroy incoming enemy projectiles. Mobs will drop character stats which will increase Pepeâ€™s speed or jumping speed. At the end of the day, we plan on having 3 stages with each accompanied with 2 kinds of unique enemy entities and a boss.
